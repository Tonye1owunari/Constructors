#Constructors:

For each object, we’ve used an object literal to specify each and every property. That’s okay on a small scale, but for serious code we need something better. That’s where object
constructors come in. With constructors we can create objects much more easily, and we can create objects that all adhere to the same design blueprint—meaning we can use constructors to ensure each object has the same properties and
includes the same methods. And with constructors we can write object code that is much more concise and a lot less error prone when we’re creating lots of objects.


Object constructors, or “constructors” for short, are your path to better object creation. Think of a constructor like a little factory that can create an endless number of similar objects.
In terms of code, a constructor is quite similar to a function that returns an object: you define it once and invoke it every time you want to create a new object.
